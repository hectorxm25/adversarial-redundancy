POWER SPECTRUM ANALYSIS RESULTS
======================================================================

Configuration:
  Number of samples: 500
  Natural dataset: /mnt/align3_drive/hectorxm/adversarial-redundancy/data/cifar10_natural
  Image size: (32, 32, 3)

Power Spectrum Statistics:
  Total frequency components: 1024
  Maximum power: 2.509282e+05
  Minimum power: 5.884122e-02
  Power ratio (max/min): 4.26e+06

Cumulative Power Distribution:
  50% of power in first    1 components (0.1% of all components)
  80% of power in first    1 components (0.1% of all components)
  90% of power in first    6 components (0.6% of all components)
  95% of power in first   25 components (2.4% of all components)
  99% of power in first  199 components (19.4% of all components)

Interpretation:
  The sharp 'elbow' in the power spectrum confirms that variance
  is concentrated in low-frequency components. This justifies the
  filtering approach: low-pass filters capture high-variance
  components, while high-pass filters capture low-variance components.

Cutoff Radii Analysis:
  r=5: Captures ~96.6% of total power
  r=10: Captures ~99.0% of total power
  r=15: Captures ~99.8% of total power
